got minimalist versions compiling;

roslaunch irb120_description irb120.launch
rosrun irb120_planner irb120_cart_move_as
rosrun cartesian_planner example_generic_cart_move_ac

need to test these libraries:
generic_arm_motion_interface
generic_cartesian_planner
generic_cartesian_planner/cartesian_interpolator

for clients, will want counterpart, currently in cartesian_planner:
ArmMotionCommander

arm_motion_interface presents an action server that accepts goals
(per #include <arm_motion_interface/cart_moveAction.h>), and maps
command codes onto corresponding functions.
These functions use FK/IK, interpolation and network solving to derive
(and execute) trajectories

status: 12/18/17:
 irb120_cart_move_as.cpp:
 instantiates an  ArmMotionInterface;
   constructor of which sets up publisher, subscriber, 
   sends robot to home pose
   starts action server "cartMoveActionServer"
   
 NEXT: need to implement function selections within action server/action client
 
 BROKE:  object_grabber, paintfile_player,
